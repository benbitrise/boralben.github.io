My name is Ben Boral. I am a software developer based in Austin, Texas, USA.

Professionally, I am a software developer in test at [RxSaver](https://www.rxsaver.com) with a particular focus on native apps.

I am a volunteer with [Citizens' Climate Lobby](https://www.cclusa.org). I am a co-creator of the [Monthly Calling Campaign](https://www.cclcalls.org) (MCC) (U.S. only). Each month, MCC sends personalized guides to calling Congress about climate change to thousands of Americans. The project is entirely [open source](https://github.com/orgs/project-grand-canyon/). [Hit me up](https://github.com/boralben) on Github to get involved!
